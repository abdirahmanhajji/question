<P>At the beginning of Samsung logo history, the company introduced a relatively complicated design. The old Samsung logo, created in 1938, first appeared on a packet of rice noodles, and didn’t include the company’s name in English. 

Like many older logos used by big brands, this symbol was intended to differentiate the company’s products in various retail locations. Eventually, it was used to mark products like vodka, wine, dried fish, and even rice. The trademark was presented in a black rectangle, with white elements. 

Korean characters were included throughout the emblem, and at the center of the rectangle, was an oval featuring rice, three lines, and three stars. The three stars were a reference to the company’s name and its meaning, as mentioned above. 

Various theories have emerged about the reason for the brand’s unique name over the years. Some people say the Samsung brand was intended to be passed over to the founder’s three sons. 

However, the company itself says the name is all about symbolism, conveying power and eternity.</P>

1993
<P>In 1993, various elements of the current Samsung logo most people are familiar with today began to emerge. The company introduced the blue color to their emblem, creating an angled blue oval background to sit behind the Samsung wordmark. 

Unlike in the previous logo, the Samsung wordmark now appeared in a white font, offering excellent contrast against the dark blue background. This new inscription also included a new modified “A” character, without the internal horizontal line. 

The removal of the horizontal line transformed the “A” into the shape of an upward pointing arrow, symbolizing ambition and growth.</p>

<p>The new Samsung logo: Samsung logo meaning
Samsung Logo
In 2005, Samsung updated its logo for the final time, drawing from the design elements used in the previous emblem. The evolution of Samsung, into a global brand with a multitude of affiliate companies under its banner, launched the need for a more straightforward symbol.

The major electronics producer maintained the blue coloring from the former logo design. However the blue appeared in the font, and the blue oval was removed. The unique typeface chosen for the previous logo also appears again here. 

The inscription primarily consists of simple, sans serif letters, common for a technology company. The letters are depicted in uppercase, to symbolize the strength of the business, and they feature bold lines, to demonstrate stability. 

The unique A character, with its missing horizontal line, indicates Samsung’s focus on continued growth and development. Alternatively, the blue color palette aligns the brand’s corporate identity with concepts like reliability and trust.</p>
